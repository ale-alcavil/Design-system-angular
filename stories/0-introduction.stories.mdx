## Getting started

This is a monorepo repository using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/), [Commitzen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) and [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) to maintain and manage component versions and for documentation, we use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/), you can access by clicking [here](https://thedesignsystem.gustavoribeiro.dev/)

## Setup

Local setup to run this project locally

### Tools:

- Node [version 10.20.1](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v10.21.0/)
  - If you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) just run the command `nvm use` in the root folder

### Configuration

- Install all the dependencies: `npm i`
- Build all the components: `npm run build`
- You can see the components of this repo by running one of these two projects:
  - Angular Playground by running `npm run playground`
  - Storybook by running `npm run start:storybook`

## Configure this project and how to install them at your project

First of all, your repository needs to be looking at the npm private repository, for that, create a `.npmrc` file at the root of your project and add the private repository:

```
registry = https://registry.npmjs.org/
@thedesignsystem:registry=http://localhost:4873/
```

### Installing components

All components in this repository are installed separately, that is, each component has its own npm package, for example if you want to install the button component:

`npm i @thedesignsystem/button`

### Installing tokens

This repository has a monorepo that gives you all the tokens of Design System's design language, styles and elements such as: colors, typography, elevations, embroidery, etc. To install just install the package in your repository:

`npm i @thedesignsystem/tokens`

In `angular.json` at `styles` node add the global `scss` file.

```json
"styles": [
  "node_modules/@thedesignsystem/tokens/bundle/bundle-hard.scss"
]
```
